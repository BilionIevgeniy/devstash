# Current Feature

Dashboard Items — @context/features/dashboard-items-spec.md

## Status

Completed

## Goals

- Replace the mock pinned and recent items in the dashboard main area with real data from the Neon database via Prisma
- Create `src/lib/db/items.ts` with data fetching functions
- Fetch items directly in the server component
- Derive the item card icon and border color from the item type
- Display item type tags and everything else currently on the cards
- Update the items stats display

## Notes

- If there are no pinned items, nothing should display in the pinned section
- Keep the current layout and design; only the data source changes (from `src/lib/mock-data.ts` to the database)
- Layout reference: @context/screenshots/dashboard-ui-main.png

## History

- Initial Setup: Next.js scaffold, removed default public assets, cleaned up globals.css and page.tsx, added context/ docs and CLAUDE.md
- Dashboard UI Phase 1: ShadCN UI setup (button, input), dark mode by default, /dashboard route with top bar (search + New Item, display only) and Sidebar/Main placeholders
- Dashboard UI Phase 2: Collapsible sidebar with item type links (/items/TYPE), favorite and recent collections, user avatar area, desktop toggle and mobile drawer (shadcn sheet and avatar)
- Dashboard UI Phase 3: Main area with 4 stats cards, collections grid (type icons and accent color derived from items), pinned items and 10 recent items, using mock data (added collectionId to mock items)
- Database Setup: Prisma 7 with Neon PostgreSQL (pg driver adapter, prisma.config.ts), initial schema with NextAuth models, many-to-many ItemCollection join table, two migrations (init, item_collections), idempotent seed script (system item types, demo user, collections, items, tags), scripts/test-db.ts for database checks
- Dashboard Collections: Collections grid and collection stats cards now load from Neon via Prisma (src/lib/db/collections.ts, src/types/collections.ts), card border color from the most-used item type, type icons for all types in a collection, /dashboard set to force-dynamic; items stats, pinned/recent items and sidebar still use mock data
- Dashboard Items: Pinned items, recent items (20 newest) and the items stats cards now load from Neon via Prisma (src/lib/db/items.ts, src/types/items.ts), item card icon and border color from the item type, tags sorted by name, pinned section hidden when empty; removed the mock helpers in dashboard-data.ts (formatShortDate moved to utils.ts) and shared the demo user email via src/lib/db/demo-user.ts; sidebar still uses mock data
